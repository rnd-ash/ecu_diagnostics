//! A crate which provides the most common ECU diagnostic protocols used by modern ECUs in vehicles,
//! as well as common hardware APIs for accessing and using diagnostic adapters
//!
//! ## ECU Diagnostic protocol support
//!
//! This crate provides the 3 most widely used diagnostic protocols used by modern ECUs from 2000 onwards
//!
//! ### On-board diagnostics (OBD2)
//! ISO9141 - OBD2 is a legal requirement on all vehicles produced from 2002, allowing for
//! reading of sensor data, reading and clearing standard DTCs, and reading basic vehicle information.
//! OBD2 is designed to be safe and simple, and does not write data to the ECU.
//!
//!
//! ### Keyword protocol 2000 (KWP2000)
//! ISO14230 - KWP2000 is a advanced diagnostic protocol utilized by many vehicle manufacturers from 2000-2006 (Superseded by UDS).
//! Unlike OBD2, KWP2000 allows for much more complex operations, which could potentially cause damage to a vehicle if used incorrectly.  
//! A few examples of features allowed by KWP2000 are
//! * ECU flashing
//! * Clearing and reading of permanent DTCs
//! * Manipulation of ECU communication parameters
//! * Low level manipulation of ECU's EEPROM or RAM
//! * Gateway access in vehicles which have them
//!
//! The specification implemented in this crate is v2.2, dated 05-08-2002.
//!
//!
//! ### Unified diagnostic services (UDS)
//! ISO14429 - UDS is an advanced diagnostic protocol utilized by almost all vehicle manufacturers from 2006 onwards. Like KWP2000,
//! this protocol allows for reading/writing directly to the ECU, and should therefore be used with caution.
//!
//! The specification implemented in this crate is the second edition, dated 01-12-2006.
//!
//! ## Hardware support (VCIs)
//!
//! This crate provides support for the following VCI adapters and hardware protocols, as well as a convenient interface
//! for making your own adapter API for customized hardware
//!
//! ### SocketCAN (Linux only)
//! This crate provides support for socketCAN compatible adapters, for utilizing both ISO-TP and regular CAN communication
//!
//! ### SAE J2534-2
//!
//! SAE J2534 (AKA Passthru) is a VCI adapter protocol which allows a VCI to communicate with a vehicle using multiple various
//! different network types, including CAN, ISO-TP, J1850, ISO9141 and SCI.
//!
//! NOTE: Although the J2534 API is officially only for Windows, it will also compile for UNIX and OSX operating
//! systems, due to the unofficial porting of the API in the [Macchina-J2534 project](https://github.com/rnd-ash/Macchina-J2534)
//!
